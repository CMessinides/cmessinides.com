			h2#heading-summary ðŸ‘‰ Summary
			p
				| In 2017, the #[cite.title Collegian Magazine] team wanted a website
				| to share their articles online. I used a headless #[abbr(title="content management system") CMS],
				| #[+link()(href="https://prismic.io") Prismic], and a static site
				| generator, #[+link()(href="https://middlemanapp.com") Middleman], to
				| create a performant website that brought the #[cite.title Magazine&rsquo;s]
				| brand to the web and gave editors the flexibility to post a vast
				| array of content.

			h2#heading-problem ðŸ¤” The problem
			p
				| Since its first issue in 2014, the #[cite.title Collegian Magazine] has published
				| investigative journalism, longform articles, interviews, photo essays, and about
				| Kenyon, Knox County, and the surrounding area. The magazine won a Pacemaker Award
				| in 2015 for its print publication, but until 2017, the #[cite.title Magazine] had
				| no platform for sharing its stories online. Then-editor-in-chief Julia Waldow
				| approached me that year to design and build a custom website for the #[cite.title Magazine]
				| to reach its readers online.
			p
				| I knew my toughest challenge would be translating the #[cite.title Magazine]&rsquo;s
				| stories from print to digital. The #[cite.title Magazine] produces beautiful print
				| design with creative layouts, especially for its photo essays, that convey narratives
				| through visuals alone. I didnâ€™t want to lose those stories in translation, so
				| so I prioritized flexibility and set out to find an interface that would allow editors
				| a high level of control over article layout.
